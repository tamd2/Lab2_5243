treat all feature vectors as presence vectors. I'm not sure how to handle
    when one feature is higher than another feature vectors same element's
    value. Does the former contribute more to the probability of the 
    element than the other? I think no for this project

Assume that when the classification runs into a case where a topic word is equally likely to be 1 as it is to be 0, that
it chooses to label it as 0
