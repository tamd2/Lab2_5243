Lab 5

How to run this program:
  Please refer to the README within the submitted folder for instructions on how to run this lab
  
No outside software was used for the cba portion of this lab. As such, all data transformations are just for prepping for our
own algorithm. Some of that transformation includes splitting the data up into topic label feature vectors and body text feature vectors.
We also generate a list of all body words to be used in finding high support words.

Who did what:
  Tim did all of the work pertaining to readying the data to do cba on. He also did all the work for finding high support words sets
  to be used in CBA. He also did all the work pertaining to generating the confident rules based on the high support word set.
  
  <Taumer: did you want credit for part of the rule generation? I can't remember what we agreed on>
  
  Taumer did all the work pertaining to testing the performance of those rules on the test set of data.
