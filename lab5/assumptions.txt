I never try to find rules where the consequent is more than one class
label. The reason for that is because for this lab, you only ever
apply the most confident rule to test data to give it a class label.
A rule such as A => {B, C} will never be more confident than A => B
so it makes no sense to look for the former rule.

We may want to leave this out of the report because it may be seen as
not doing the algorithm correctly?


I did not force the topic words to have high support in order to be part of rules. 
I think this was because not very many topic words had high enough support. We should discuss if
this needs to be fixed or if we should admit to it.
