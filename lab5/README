how to run this program:

$ python minwise.py <input file> <optional: max number of documents>

So for example, to run this program on an input file such as freq_dat_5000 found in the datafiles folder:

$ python minwise.py datafiles/freq_dat_5000

This program may take a while, so you can limit the number of documents it analyzes by adding on that number to the end of the command:

$ python minwise.py datafiles/freq_dat_5000 100

The above limits it to the first 100 documents from the input file

The output of this file is the time taken to compute the baseline jaccard,
the time taken to build the estimates for each of the k permutations,
and the mean squared errors of each of those estimates.
