how to run this program:

$ python cba.py <input file> <min support percent> <min confidence percent> <percent of docs to train on> <optional: max number of documents>

So for example, to run this program on an input file such as 
freq_dat_5000 found in the datafiles folder with min support of 50%,
min confidence of 60%, and train on 90% of the documents:

$ python cba.py datafiles/freq_dat_5000 50 60 90

This program may take a while, so you can limit the number of documents it analyzes by adding on that number to the end of the command:

$ python cba.py datafiles/freq_dat_5000 50 60 90 100

The above limits it to the first 100 documents from the input file
