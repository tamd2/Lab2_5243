Taumer:

this program is kind of slow, so start out by limiting your runs to a 
few hundred documents. Check the readme for how to do that

There were a few things I want you to make sure to get in the report:
    discuss # of permutations vs time and vs MSE

    discuss how the sparseness of the data may limit minwise hashing's
        effectiveness as a faster solution. I suspect it does, but
        if you disagree you can write what you think. My hunch
        is that the sparseness makes these estimates much more
        accurate, but makes the estimates take longer because they
        have to spend a while searching for a 1 to appear, and that
        may involve traversing most of the binary string. When you are
        going through the binary string over and over, and each time
        covers most of the string, it stops being faster than the
        baseline which goes through just one full time.

    after those two, I leave it up to you. Let me know if you need my
    help on anything
