What is implemented:
    for this lab, we have implemented K-Means and dbscan for our clustering algorithms. For our two distance metrics, we chose to
implement Manhattan distance and Euclidian distance


Underlying assumptions:
    for K-Means:

    for dbscan:
        1) If a point is equal to epsilon in distance away, it is counted as a neighbor
        2) A point cannot be its own neighbor
       
    for measuring clustering quality:
        1) for entropy, I used log base 2 as this class recommends
 

How to use this project:
    There are two python script files for this project, one for K-Means, and one for dbscan. Each has a README file that will
explain how to run the file including how to change the parameters for K, epsilon, input data, etc.


Scalability:
    for K-Means:


    for dbscan:


Quality of clustering:
    for K-Means:


    for dbscan:
